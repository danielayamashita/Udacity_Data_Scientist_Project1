# Udacity_Data_Scientist_Project1

This GitHub project contains all piece of code used to analyse the StackOverflow's survey from 2011 to 2017 to help anwser three business question related to software developer career, notably:

  * What have been the most used programming language in the last years?
  * Among the programming language most used in the last years, which one is the best paied?
  * What is the average age of people who program these type of languages and what do they recommend to become professional?
  
The dataset used for this analysis is csv files that must be saved in the folder './Database'. Due to limitations in the space of GitHub repository, the dataset is available in [this link](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) 

The analysis of these data was implemented in Python by means of a Jupyter Notebook named 'Project1.ipynb'. The libraries used in this project are:
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Collections
  
## Main conclusions:
From this analysis, it was constated that Python has become an important type of programming language, being increasiangly more popular and well-paied.

Furthermore, it was analysed how to start learning it. Based on the StakeOverflow survey of 2017, it was analysed the recommendation of participants to be proficient in software development. It was concluded that attending online courses and practicing exercises of a book are the most recommended methods to start programming.
